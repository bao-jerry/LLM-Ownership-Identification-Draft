# Yes, That's Mine: Asymptotically Foolproof LLM Ownership Verification Against Hidden Adversarial Decoding Parameter Perturbations

## Working Abstract (Draft)
Creating and training an LLM can take vast amounts of resources, money, and effort. Because of this, many LLM creators seek to protect their credit and IP from being stolen. 'LLM ownership verification' is therefore one of the primary commercial motivators for the research of LLM provenance. White-box methods and backdoor-style black-box methods for LLM ownership verification face challenges with constrained practical assumptions and invasiveness, driving the search for effective and non-invasive black-box methods. We identify a practice-theory gap in the current research for non-invasive, black-box methods, and as such, we propose a collaborative formal program for classifying threat models which admit 'theoretically foolproof' (in the sense of decidability, statistical consistensy, etc.) methods of LLM ownership verification. As the first step in this formal program, we argue that hidden decoding parameter perturbations are the necessary first model-identity-obfuscation class to investigate. We then present a group of statistically consistent tests for identifying an LLM's ownership identity under such perturbations. The methods presented in this paper will satisfy desirable properties such as: 1) being non-invasive and fully black box, 2) being statistically consistent, 3) being viable against an adversary with perfect information, 4) emitting useful intermediate results that may be useful in other research, and 5) being viable for further optimization. Along the way, we will have proven a fundamental negative result: standard, token-distribution-modifying decoding parameters are not obfuscating enough to prevent the existence of a theoretically foolproof method for verifying LLM ownership identity. Furthermore, we will have established the first evidence that the proposed formal program for proving similar results under other threat scenarios is viable.
